There are N buckets arranged in row list. Each bucket either is empty or contains a ball. The buckets are specified as a string buckets consisting of characters (empty bucket) and B" (bucket with a ball). For example, "B.BB.B..B" In one move you can take the ball out of any bucket and place it in another (empty) bucket. Your goal is to arrange the balls to create an alternating sequence of full and empty buckets. In other words, the distance between two consecutive balls should be equal to 2. Note that the sequence may start at any bucket. What is the minimum number of moves required to create a correct sequence of balls in buckets? Write a function: def solution (buckets) that, given a string buckets of length N, returns the minimum number of moves required to create the described sequence. If it is impossible to create a correct sequence, return -1. Examples: a) Given buckets = "..B....B.BB", the function should return 2. b) Given buckets = "BB.B.BBB..." the function should return 4. c) Given buckets = BBB.B the function should return -1 because it is impossible to create a correct sequence. d) Given buckets ="......B.B", the function should return 0. There is no need to move any ball because the sequence is already correct.
